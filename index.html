                    Hello, my name is Darren Li, a sophomore at Stony Brook University, where I am passionately
                    pursuing a double major in computer science and applied mathematics. From a young age,
                    the internet fascinated me, I remembered the stirring exhilaration with every
                    encounter with new technology. As I surfed the internet with each mouse movement and keystroke,
                    it had began my humble curiosisty at how these machines and applications work. This humble
                    curiosity became a driving force that propelled me towards academia and beyond. Surfing the internet
                    became more than just a pastime; it was an educational journey, laying the foundation for my
                    academic pursuits.
